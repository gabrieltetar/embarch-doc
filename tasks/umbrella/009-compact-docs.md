# 009 — embarch-umbrella's spec.md and open.md are in reserve

**State:** blocked
**Source:** scripts/check-doc-size.py --pressure
**Scope:** umbrella
**Hardware:** none
**Compacts:** embarch-umbrella/spec.md, embarch-umbrella/open.md
**In flux:** yes — six open tasks, and every one of them rewrites the doctor table in spec.md
**Must not delete:** spec.md's nineteen-row `doctor` table, and in particular which rows are **designed and unbuilt** — five decisions describe checks that do not exist, the doc asserted four of them as shipped for weeks, and that table is now the only place the distinction lives; open.md's note that check 15 is not a hash comparison and must not be read as one.

## What

`spec.md` is at ~93% of 10 KB and `open.md` at ~94% of 5 KB. Both had a pass on
2026-09-04 whose main find was a duplication rather than cold prose:
`decisions/doctor.md` was re-arguing build status that `spec.md`'s table owns,
worth ~1.2 KB. Run `scripts/check-duplication.py embarch-umbrella` before
anything else — the same class may still be there between `spec.md` and
`decisions/projects.md` or `decisions/release.md`.

## Why blocked

Tasks 003–008 are all open, all in this sub-project, and between them they build
`setup --dry-run`, check 10's handshake, `doctor --prune`, check 5's
not-permitted branch, check 8's shellout and check 11's `embarch-api versions`
read. **Every one of those changes a row of the table this task would be
compacting**, and several close an `open.md` bullet outright. Compacting first
means writing a clean statement of five things about to become false.

**Unparks when the umbrella queue is down to one open task**, whichever it is.
Not on a timer, and not on "enough of them landed".

## Done when

- [ ] Both files out of reserve.
- [ ] The unbuilt/built distinction survives, per row.
- [ ] No question disappears from `collect-open-questions.py` unless you can
      name it as answered.
- [ ] `DOC-COMPACTION.md` §7's question answered in the commit message.
- [ ] Gate green, `changelog.d/umbrella-*` fragment dropped.
